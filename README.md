# Bejewelled Blitz Game

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Bejewelled Blitz game developed as a first-semester project at FAST-NUCES Lahore campus. The game involves swapping three or more jewels of the same type in a row or column to score points and trigger special gems for additional effects. The project utilized C++ programming language and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) version 2.6.1.

## Features
- **Jewel Swapping:** Players can swap jewels using the arrow keys (up, down, right, left) on the keyboard.
- **Special Gems:**
  1. *Flame Gem:* Formed when four similar jewels combine. When the flame gem combines with three or four same-color gems, it triggers a fiery blast in a 3 by 3 radius.
  2. *Destroyer Gem:* Formed when five jewels are arranged in an elbow shape. When the destroyer gem combines with three or four same-color gems, it causes destruction and explodes the particular row and column it is in.

## Gameplay
- **Controls:**
  - Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Right, Left): Move the cursor.
  - Enter Key: Select a jewel.
  - Arrow Keys: Swap the selected jewel with an adjacent one.

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to select a jewel.
2. Press Enter to choose the selected jewel.
3. Use the arrow keys again to swap the selected jewel with an adjacent one.
4. Match three or more jewels of the same type in a row or column to score points.
5. Trigger special gems for additional effects.
6. The objective is to match gems strategically to maximize points.
